## Overview: 
In order to predict the likelihood that a bike share company would be profitable in Des Moines, Iowa, data from New York City’s Citi Bike program were analyzed. Trends in data from August 2019 were considered such as duration of ride, peak hours, weekly ride statistics, popularity of station and usage by gender and user type.

## Results: 
Trends in trip duration indicate most of the rides tend to last between 5 and 15 minutes.

There is no significant change observed in the overall trip duration trend based on rider’s gender.

During the work week (Mon-Fri) the peak riding hours appear to be during rush hour; around 7am-9am and 5-7pm. This makes sense given how heavy traffic around d the city would be during these times. On Saturdays and Sundays, we see these shift to the middle of the day when people are out enjoying their weekend and exploring downtown.

There is no obvious change observed in peak riding hour trends based on rider’s gender.

Trends by user type reveal most subscribers utilize the biking service Mon-Fri; whereas customers are more prone to use the bikes on weekends. We can explore these trends further with a filterable stacked bar chart.

Geographically, we can observe patterns in start and end locations. By using the streets basemap we can gain additional context regarding what is around the hotspots of activity. Many of the more popular locations tend to be by train and metro stops. Filtering the data by gender or day of the week allows us to explore whether certain areas of the city are more popular based on day or possible gender preferences. To truly dig into the various factors impacting the popularity of station locations, a more robust, regression analysis would need to be conducted.

For the month of August an interesting trend arises when filtering bike rides by gender and day of the week. We can see that women most frequently use the bike service on Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. While men tend to use the bike service the least on Saturdays and the most on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

## Summary:
It is worth considering the demographic similarities and differences between New York City and Des Moines when determining how applicable this data analysis can be for determining whether a bike share company will be successful in Des Moines.  Two additional visualizations I would recommend creating would be a route analysis of each bike trip to gain a better understanding of traffic patterns and I would also consider folding in weather data to observe how mother nature impacts bike usage.
